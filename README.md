# Word Sense Disambiguation
* knowledge-based word sense disambiguation using hierarchical code representation learning.

## preliminary
* This repository wiil be the implementation of the WSD using hierarchical code representation learning (in near future).
* Summary of the proposed method is as follows.
  1. Assign the ground-truth M-ary N-digits discrete hierarchical code for each WordNet synsets by traversing the hyponymy relation taxonomy.
  2. Train the encoder that transforms BERT embeddings into the hierarchical code by utilizing the assigned ground-truth synset code as the supervision signal.
  3. (TBA)
